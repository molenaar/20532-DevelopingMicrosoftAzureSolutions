# Module 8: Designing a Communication Strategy by Using Queues and Service Bus

# Lab: Using Queues and Service Bus to Manage Communication Between Web Applications in Azure

## Exercise 1: Creating an Azure Service Bus Namespace

#### Task 1: Create the Service Bus namespace by using the Portal

> **Note:** Service Bus functionality is not available yet in the new Portal. Because of this, the Classic Portal will be used for this lab.

1. Go to [*https://manage.windowsazure.com*](https://manage.windowsazure.com)

1. In the email address box, type the email address of your Microsoft account.

1. In the password box, type the password for your Microsoft account.

1. Click **Sign In** In the navigation pane on the left side

1. In the navigation pane on the left side of the screen, scroll down, and then click **Service Bus**.

1. At the bottom of the screen, click the **Create** button.

1. In the **Create a Namespace** dialog box, perform the following steps:

  a. In the **Namespace Name** box, type **sb20532[*Your Name*]**.

  b. In the **Region** list, select the region that is closest to your location.

  c. In the **Type** list, select the **Messaging** option.

  d. In the **Messaging Tier** list, select the **Standard** option.

  e. Click the check mark button to create your namespace.

  > **Note:** It takes approximately 1-2 minutes to create your Service Bus namespace instance.

1. In the list of **Service Bus** namespaces, click the namespace that you just created.

1. At the bottom of the screen, click **Connection Information**.

1. Record the *RootManageSharedAccessKey* connection string from the **Access connection information** dialog box.

  > **Note:** You must record a connection string from the list of SAS items.

1. Close the **Access connection information** dialog box.

1. At the top of the screen, click the **Queues** tab.

1. At the bottom-left corner of the screen, click **New**.

1. If it is not automatically selected, select **App Services > Service Bus > Queue > Custom Create**.

1. In the **Create a Queue** dialog box, perform the following steps:

  a. In the **Queue** **Name** box, type **signin**.

  b. In the **Region** list, select the same region that you selected for the namespace.

  c. In the **Namespace** box, provide the value **sb20532[Your Name]**.

  d. Click next arrow to move to the next step in the wizard.

  e. Leave all fields as their default values.
